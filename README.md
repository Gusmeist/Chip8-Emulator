# Chip8 Emulator

This is a very basic emulator of the standard Chip8 instruction set.  It is capable of playing roms (No sound).  The keyboard is the 16 keys on the left side (1-4, q-r, a-f, z-v).  Pressing 0 enables and disables stepping mode, which will process 1 instruction for each press of the up arrow key.

Currently I have stopped work to make this a more fully fledged project because 1. I want to move on to something new and 2. I am currently inable to make a proper gui like I wanted to.  One day I shall return.
